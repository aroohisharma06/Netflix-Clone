                        Additionally, Netflix allows parents to set up parental controls to restrict access to certain types of content based on maturity rating. Overall, Netflix can be a good option for kids, but it's always a good idea for parents to review the content and use parental controls to ensure a safe viewing experience for their children.</p>
